# HomadeGraphicsTranformations 
This is my implementation of 3d transformations, applying matrix operations. The file "transformations.py" contains the set of classes and methods for making some transformations.

## solutions
myOps.py : is the file with solution to the first homework of the assignment.


pyramid.py : is the solution to the pyramid problem, but moving back and 
forward by 15°, to demonstrate the solution.


pyramid_two: has the solution to the pyramid proble, but it just rotates
by -15° on Y.


pyramid_ops: display the calculations and results of the rotation in 
each point.


transformations.py: is the developed module, that containt all the 
methods for doing transformations to the vertices and objects.

## Running requirenments
```
pip install PyOpenGL PyOpenGL_accelerate
pip install pygame
```

## Moving around the pygame environment
keys 1, 2, 3, 4 are the keys for controlling rotation.
keys ASDW are the keys for moving up, down, left and right.
